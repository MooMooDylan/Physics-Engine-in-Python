Physics and stuff. In python
By: Dylan Ku
Created: 1 - 22 - 25

This is based on Two-Bit Coding's C# tutorial on Youtube. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSlpr6o9vURwq3oxVZSimY8iC-cdd3kIs
This is my first big project in Python and Pygame
GitHub:

README updated: 1 - 31 -26
Required:
pygame
Note: The physics code itself does not use pygame, only game.py However in the future that might change.

If you need to this should help you find a definition your looking for.

Format of game.py:

Imports
    This is where all the physics classes and functions are imported

Class Colors
    This is a class of colors (tuples)

Rendering Class
    The scale of the game is set and the zoom is initialized. Next are functions that make it easier to display physics data like vectors and rigidbodies without having to worry about the scale and zoom.
    Main ones to use:
        RenderVector()
        RenderCircle()
        RenderBox()
        RenderPolygon()

Pygame Setup
    This is where the game clock, window dimensions, game world dimensions are set in order to create the window

Initilize
    This is where the initialization of objects happens. Variables, Vectors, RigidBodies ect.
    This will be the most modified per commit for testings sake.

Main Loop
    This is where the magic happens. Each tick is executed like this:
    1. Rendering
    2. Events (ie inputs)
    3. Update velocities and positions
    4. Check for collisions
